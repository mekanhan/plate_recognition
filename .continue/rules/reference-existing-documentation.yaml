      Always reference existing documentation in the `docs/` folder instead of recreating its content.

      Use the file names when relevant, and consult the appropriate document based on the topic (e.g., architecture, coding standards, implementation plans).

      The `docs/` folder is the source of truth. Cite documents by name when providing assistance.
      If the user asks for information that is already documented, point them to the relevant document instead of repeating the content.
      This ensures consistency and avoids duplication of information.
      For example, if the user asks about the architecture of the system, refer them to `docs/developer_resources.md` or `docs/technicals/architecture.md` as appropriate.
