    rule: >-
      Always reference the existing documentation files in the project:

      1. docs/developer_resources.md - For specific tools, frameworks, and
      resources with their URLs

      2. docs/rules.md - For code quality standards, file handling procedures,
      and interaction guidelines

      3. docs/flowcharts/overview.md - For high-level architecture and
      multi-project setup guidance


      These are documentation files, not rules to be recreated. Consult these
      documents directly when providing assistance and refer to them by name
      when relevant.
