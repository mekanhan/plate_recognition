# Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance Plan - Phase 2

---

## 1. Test Framework Architecture

### Unified Java Testing Framework

**Stack:** Java 21 + Selenium 4 + TestNG + Cucumber + Maven + Allure Reports

* **Frontend Testing:** Selenium WebDriver with Page Object Model
* **Backend API Testing:** REST Assured integrated in same framework
* **Database Testing:** TestContainers for database integration tests
* **Performance Testing:** Separate JMeter framework for load testing

## 2. Test Scenarios by Feature Category

### Core Detection Features

* **Live Camera Detection:** Real-time processing, accuracy validation, performance benchmarks
* **Image Upload Detection:** File validation, batch processing, error handling
* **Detection Results Management:** CRUD operations, search/filter, export functionality

### Real-time Streaming

* **WebSocket Connections:** Connection stability, message delivery, error recovery
* **Live Video Feed:** Stream quality, detection overlay accuracy, performance monitoring

### Data Management

* **Database Operations:** Data persistence, query performance, data integrity
* **File Storage:** Image/video storage, cleanup processes, storage limits

### System Integration

* **Multi-Camera Support:** Camera discovery, configuration, failover scenarios
* **API Endpoints:** All REST endpoints with positive/negative test cases
* **Configuration Management:** Settings validation, real-time updates

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline with Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Testing (Before Merge)

`# .github/workflows/pre-commit-tests.yml`

* **Pre-commit hooks:** Code formatting, linting, security scan
* **Unit Tests:** Python backend services (pytest)
* **Integration Tests:** Database and API contract tests
* **Security Scan:** Bandit for Python, OWASP for dependencies
* **Code Coverage:** Minimum 80% threshold enforcement

### Pull Request Validation

`# .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`

* **Static Analysis:** SonarQube integration with quality gates
* **Java UI Automation:** Critical path scenarios (smoke tests)
* **API Testing:** Contract validation and regression tests
* **Performance Check:** Basic performance regression detection
* **Claude PR Review:** Automated code review integration

### Full Test Suite (Post-merge)

`# .github/workflows/full-test-suite.yml`

* **Complete UI Test Suite:** All user journeys and edge cases
* **End-to-End Testing:** Multi-camera scenarios, video processing
* **Performance Testing:** Load testing with JMeter
* **Security Testing:** Full security scan with reporting

## 4. Industry Best Practices Implementation

### Testing Pyramid Approach

* **70% Unit Tests:** Fast, isolated service/repository testing
* **20% Integration Tests:** API and database integration
* **10% E2E Tests:** Critical user journeys via UI

### Quality Gates Enforcement

* **Code Coverage:** 80% minimum for new code
* **Test Success Rate:** 100% pass rate required
* **Performance:** No regression beyond 10% baseline
* **Security:** Zero high/critical vulnerabilities

### Parallel Execution Strategy

* **UI Tests:** Parallel browser execution (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* **API Tests:** Concurrent endpoint testing
* **Cross-environment:** Docker-based test environments

---

## 5. Test Data & Environment Management

### Test Data Strategy

* **Synthetic Data:** Generated test images and videos
* **Test Doubles:** Mocked camera feeds and external services
* **Database Seeding:** Automated test data creation

### Environment Strategy

* **Docker Compose:** Isolated test environments
* **TestContainers:** Database and service containers
* **Configuration Management:** Environment-specific test configs

---

## 6. Reporting & Monitoring

### Test Reporting

* **Allure Reports:** Rich HTML reports with screenshots/videos
* **Real-time Dashboards:** Test execution monitoring
* **Trend Analysis:** Test stability and performance trends

### Notifications & Alerts

* **Slack Integration:** Test failure notifications
* **Email Reports:** Daily/weekly test summaries
* **GitHub Integration:** PR status checks and comments

---

## 7. Implementation Timeline

* **Week 1-2:** Framework setup and basic scenarios
* **Week 3-4:** CI/CD pipeline integration and quality gates
* **Week 5-6:** Complete scenario coverage and performance testing
* **Week 7-8:** Monitoring, reporting, and optimization
