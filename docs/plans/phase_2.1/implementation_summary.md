## 📋 Implementation Details

### Modified Files

#### 1. `/app/services/detection_service.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Added ObjectTracker initialization in `__init__()`
- Integrated tracker.update() in `process_frame()`
- Added tracking ID assignment and registry management
- Enhanced class-specific processing logic
- Extended performance metrics with tracking data

**Key Code Changes:**
```python
# Initialize object tracker
from app.services.tracker import ObjectTracker
self.object_tracker = ObjectTracker()
self.tracked_objects = {}  # Maps tracking_id to last seen info

# Update object tracker with detections
tracked_detections = self.object_tracker.update(tracker_detections, frame)

# Merge tracking IDs back into original detections
for i, detection in enumerate(detections):
    if i < len(tracked_detections) and "object_id" in tracked_detections[i]:
        tracking_id = tracked_detections[i]["object_id"]
        detection["tracking_id"] = f"trk-{tracking_id}"
```

#### 2. `/app/services/stream_processor.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Added object lifecycle management configuration
- Implemented expired object cleanup mechanism
- Enhanced metrics with tracking information

**Key Code Changes:**
```python
# Object lifecycle management
self.tracked_objects_cleanup_interval = 30.0  # Clean up every 30 seconds
self.object_expiry_time = 60.0  # Objects expire after 60 seconds

async def _cleanup_expired_objects(self, detection_service):
    """Clean up expired tracking objects"""
    # Find and remove expired objects based on last_seen timestamp
```

#### 3. `/app/services/license_plate_recognition_service.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Added class_name field to detection results
- Enhanced metadata for tracking integration

**Key Code Changes:**
```python
plate_result["class_name"] = "license_plate"  # Add class name for tracking
```

## 🔄 Processing Flow (Updated)

### Before Implementation
```
Frame → Detection → OCR → Storage → Display
```

### After Implementation  
```
Frame → Detection → Object Tracking → Class Check → OCR (if license_plate) → Storage → Display → Cleanup
```

### Detailed Flow
1. **Video Frame Input** - Frame received from camera/stream
2. **Object Detection** - YOLO detects license plates and assigns bounding boxes
3. **Object Tracking** - DeepSort assigns consistent tracking IDs across frames
4. **Class Validation** - Check if detection is actually a license plate
5. **OCR Processing** - Run text recognition only on license plate detections
6. **Storage** - Save detection with persistent tracking ID
7. **Display** - Show annotated frame with tracking IDs
8. **Cleanup** - Remove expired tracking objects to maintain memory efficiency

## 📊 New Data Structure

### Detection Object (Enhanced)
```json
{
  "detection_id": "uuid-string",
  "tracking_id": "trk-12345",
  "class_name": "license_plate",
  "plate_text": "ABC1234",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "box": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
  "timestamp": 1718640123.456,
  "frame_id": 1234,
  "last_seen": 1718640123.456
}
```

### Tracking Registry
```python
tracked_objects = {
  "12345": {
    "last_seen": 1718640123.456,
    "frame_count": 1234,
    "class_name": "license_plate"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration Parameters

### Object Tracking
- **Tracker Type:** DeepSort (with SimpleTracker fallback)
- **ID Format:** `trk-{tracking_id}` for tracked objects
- **Fallback Format:** `det-{frame_count}-{index}` for untracked

### Lifecycle Management
- **Cleanup Interval:** 30 seconds
- **Object Expiry:** 60 seconds
- **Cleanup Trigger:** Automatic during frame processing

### Performance Optimization
- **Class Filtering:** Only process `class_name == "license_plate"`
- **OCR Threshold:** Only run OCR on valid license plate detections
- **Tracking Fallback:** Graceful degradation if DeepSort fails

  "tracking_objects_count": 0,    # NEW
  "tracking_success_rate": 0      # NEW
